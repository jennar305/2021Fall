# 2021Fall - About Me

  I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business Administration. I have some computer/technical experience from a young age. I was always fascinated with coding and making my own websites when I was around eleven years old. I started off using hosting websites such as Wix and Blogger to make little web pages about me and the things I liked. I eventually learned how I could create my own webpage using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. I taught myself the basics of each using Google Search and YouTube and would then code websites for my personal use. They were never actually hosted on the internet since I had to pay to get hosting rights, but I still loved making them nonetheless. I moved onto Tumblr as I got older and would create my own themes instead of using the pre-made ones. I eventually decided I wanted to learn more than just HTML and CSS and I loved the idea of creating software and applications. From there I decided to study Computer Science in college. Some of the courses I have taken are Computer Science I, II, and III, Object Oriented Program, Assembly Language and Architecture, Language Processing and Software Enginnering. Some others include Calc I and II. One big project I worked on recently was for my Software Engineering course. Me, along with a group of others created a Point of Sales system for a supermarket. We used HTML, CSS, php and sql to create the system.
  With what I learn in this course, I see myself creating more advanced web pages and apps. Using my previous knowledge and love of HTML and CSS, I can finally learn and understand more ways to create webpages that are useful and entertaining. I will finally make an app for the first time and bring my previous ideas to life.
